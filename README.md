# Professional-Projects
👋🏾  Hi, I'm Amyre Polk

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for cybersecurity and networking. I'm building real-world projects as I study for certifications like CompTIA Network+ and Security+.

💻 I learn best by doing — so this repo is a collection of hands-on labs that show what I can actually do.

🧠 My strengths:
- Attention to detail
- Creative problem-solving
- Staying committed, even when life gets hectic

🌱 Right now, I'm learning:
- Network+ fundamentals (IP, routing, VLANs)
- Security+ concepts (access control, risk management)
- How to build a portfolio that reflects *me*

Thanks for stopping by
