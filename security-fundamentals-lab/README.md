# Security Fundamentals Lab

This project demonstrates core Security+ fundamentals through a realistic small company scenario. It includes an asset inventory, threat model, access control matrix, incident analysis, and basic system hardening using PowerShell. The goal is to show practical understanding of confidentiality, integrity, availability, risk, threats, and access control.
