# 🔒 Project 1: Policy Review Integrity Report (PRIR) 

### **Goal and Executive Summary**
This project demonstrates foundational knowledge of **security governance** and **risk management** by performing a **Gap Analysis** on a weak corporate access control policy. The process involved identifying specific vulnerabilities within the initial policy, mapping those gaps to core security principles (CIA Triad and AAA), and engineering a **hardened policy (V2.0)** that implements appropriate **Security Controls**.

### **Security+ Domain and Concepts Applied**
This project is highly relevant to **Domain 2.0 (Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities)** and **Domain 4.0 (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)**.

| Core Principle | Demonstrated Concept |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CIA Triad** | Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability |
| **Access Control** | Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (**AAA**) |
| **Cryptographic Concepts** | Non-Repudiation (via Digital Signatures and Protected Logs) |
| **Security Controls** | Principle of Least Privilege (**PoLP**), Role-Based Access Control (**RBAC**), Multi-Factor Authentication (**MFA**), and Backups. |

### **Project Workflow and File Structure**

| File | Purpose | Key Takeaway Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01-BeginnerCorp_Access_Policy_V1.0_AS_IS.md` | The flawed, baseline policy requiring analysis. | **Identifying Vulnerabilities** (Weak Passwords, Open Access) |
| `02-PHM_PRIR_Report_V1.0.md` | The core **Gap Analysis Report** and security control recommendations. | **Critical Thinking & Analytical Skills** (Mapping gaps to CIA/AAA principles) |
| `03-BeginnerCorp_Access_Policy_V2.0_TO_BE.md` | The final, **hardened policy** incorporating all recommendations. | **Solution Engineering** (Implementing PoLP, MFA, RBAC, and Accounting) |
